    AbstractAccumulator

An abstract type for accumulators.

An accumulator is an object that may change its value at every tilde_assume!! or
tilde_observe!! call based on the random variable in question. The obvious examples of
accumulators are the log prior and log likelihood. Other examples might be a variable that
counts the number of observations in a trace, or a list of the names of random variables
seen so far.

An accumulator type `T <: AbstractAccumulator` must implement the following methods:
- `accumulator_name(acc::T)` or `accumulator_name(::Type{T})`
- `accumulate_observe!!(acc::T, right, left, vn)`
- `accumulate_assume!!(acc::T, val, logjac, vn, right)`

To be able to work with multi-threading, it should also implement:
- `split(acc::T)`
- `combine(acc::T, acc2::T)`

See the documentation for each of these functions for more details.
"""
abstract type AbstractAccumulator end

"""
    accumulator_name(acc::AbstractAccumulator)

Return a Symbol which can be used as a name for `acc`.

The name has to be unique in the sense that a `VarInfo` can only have one accumulator for
each name. The most typical case, and the default implementation, is that the name only
depends on the type of `acc`, not on its value.
"""
accumulator_name(acc::AbstractAccumulator) = accumulator_name(typeof(acc))

"""
    accumulate_observe!!(acc::AbstractAccumulator, right, left, vn)

Update `acc` in a `tilde_observe!!` call. Returns the updated `acc`.

`vn` is the name of the variable being observed, `left` is the value of the variable, and
`right` is the distribution on the RHS of the tilde statement. `vn` is `nothing` in the case
of literal observations like `0.0 ~ Normal()`.

`accumulate_observe!!` may mutate `acc`, but not any of the other arguments.

See also: [`accumulate_assume!!`](@ref)
"""
function accumulate_observe!! end

"""
    accumulate_assume!!(acc::AbstractAccumulator, val, logjac, vn, right)

Update `acc` in a `tilde_assume!!` call. Returns the updated `acc`.

`vn` is the name of the variable being assumed, `val` is the value of the variable (in the
original, unlinked space), and `right` is the distribution on the RHS of the tilde
statement. `logjac` is the log determinant of the Jacobian of the transformation that was
done to convert the value of `vn` as it was given to `val`: for example, if the sampler is
operating in linked (Euclidean) space, then logjac will be nonzero.

`accumulate_assume!!` may mutate `acc`, but not any of the other arguments.

See also: [`accumulate_observe!!`](@ref)
"""
function accumulate_assume!! end

"""
    split(acc::AbstractAccumulator)

Return a new accumulator like `acc` but empty.

The precise meaning of "empty" is that that the returned value should be such that
`combine(acc, split(acc))` is equal to `acc`. This is used in the context of multi-threading
where different threads may accumulate independently and the results are then combined.

See also: [`combine`](@ref)
"""
function split end

"""
    combine(acc::TAcc, acc2::TAcc) where {TAcc<:AbstractAccumulator}

Combine two accumulators of the same type. Returns a new accumulator of the same type.

"""
function combine end

# TODO(mhauru) The existence of this function makes me sad. See comment in unflatten in
# src/varinfo.jl.
"""
    convert_eltype(::Type{T}, acc::AbstractAccumulator)

Convert `acc` to use element type `T`.

What "element type" means depends on the type of `acc`. By default this function does
nothing. Accumulator types that need to hold differentiable values, such as dual numbers
used by various AD backends, should implement a method for this function.
"""
convert_eltype(::Type, acc::AbstractAccumulator) = acc

"""
    AccumulatorTuple{N,T<:NamedTuple}

A collection of accumulators, stored as a `NamedTuple` of length `N`

This is defined as a separate type to be able to dispatch on it cleanly and without method
ambiguities or conflicts with other `NamedTuple` types. We also use this type to enforce the
constraint that the name in the tuple for each accumulator `acc` must be
`accumulator_name(acc)`, and these names must be unique.

The constructor can be called with a tuple or a `VarArgs` of `AbstractAccumulators`. The
names will be generated automatically. One can also call the constructor with a `NamedTuple`
but the names in the argument will be discarded in favour of the generated ones.

Add `acc` to `at`. Returns a new `AccumulatorTuple`.

corresponding function for `AbstractVarInfo`.
